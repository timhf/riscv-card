# RISC-V Reference Card

An unofficial reference sheet for RISC-V, the free and libre ISA from Berkeley. ([**PDF**][pdf]).

Based on a [repo](https://github.com/jameslzhu/riscv-card/) by James Zhu.

## What's inside?

- The base ISA (RV32I), with opcode values and C-like descriptions
- Standard ISA extensions (most but not all yet)
- Register aliases and calling conventions
- Pseudoinstructions

Other information from the more official reference cards not specific to the ISA,
like the stack/heap memory layout, IEEE 754 floating-point layout, and size prefixes,
have been omitted.

## Why?

In RISC tradition, the assembly reference for [MIPS][mips-green-sheet]
and [RISC-V][riscv-card] fit onto a single double-sided page.

Alas, when I took [CS 61C][cs61c] at UC Berkeley in 2017, we were the first semester taught
using RISC-V, and our reference card scans from our [RISC-V textbook][patterson-hennessy]
were low-quality. I wanted a card I didn't have to squint at, so I typeset it in LaTeX.
The new scan (linked above) is high-quality but is still not text-friendly.

This little reference has grown well past a double-sided page, but if you still want
the original you can print the first and last pages for the asm opcodes and calling convention.

## Contributing

This repository is not actively developed, but pull requests are accepted for
fixes, new ISA standard extensions, style improvements, or other such changes.
Please include a rebuilt PDF binary in your pull request.

Print-friendly format is preferred, when possible: legible font sizes, clean
page breaks and full letter page width usage.
(A4 support may be a good thing to check.)

Some ideas if you are truly motivated:
- Multiple outputs (pdfs) for different domains / ISA extension sets, or for 32
  / 64-bit support
- Directly parsing the spec, banishing typos forever
- Build system to select binary or hex instruction opcodes
- Other ISA support? (probably only feasible for RISC ISAs)
